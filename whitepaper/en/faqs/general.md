<summary><strong>What is untrading?</strong></summary>

untrading.org implements Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-5173), which eliminates conflicts of interest and ends the zero-sum mentality currently practiced by all exchanges by creating a trustless Giftchain for each token among creators, buyers, and sellers using an improved NFT framework.

Built on a DeFi protocol with the implementation of non-fungible Future Rewards (nFR) architecture, the Giftchain aims to eliminate the zero-sum mentality of trading by creating more value together, rather than for one individual to gain at the expense of another, thereby ending a vicious cycle that sees traders lose everything in six to 24 months.

**Giftchains**: Giftchains are decentralized, on-chain communities made up of all the buyers and sellers of an NFT token.

**On-chain nFR payments:** Uses are no longer at odds with each other, nor with the platform. They are no longer chess pieces in a zero-sum game. A gain is no longer a loss for another. In addition to eliminating the need for lots of trades to generate transaction fees, the platform implements a revolutionary on-chain payment system that rewards ownership chain ownership, and discourages royalty circumvention.

**All assets:** This new trading framework works with all assets that can be tokenized, including real estate, cryptos, tokenized stocks, and startup team projects, in addition to being an art NFT protocol.&#x20;

**Community:** Each project that originated and traded on the platform will benefit when each of its living communities contributes to its success.

<summary>This is yet another NFT marketplace, isn't it?</summary>

It isn't just NFTs. untrading.org is a trading and investment platform that is based on the NFT framework for all tokenized asset classes. On the blockchain, Originators' Reward (ORs) and Future Reward (FRs) create trustless Giving Circles among owners, fostering a strong community and aligning the interests of the platform and its users.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is untrading.org different from other NFT marketplaces?</summary>

untrading.org stands out from all other platforms in four major ways:

1. **A lower transaction cost:** untrading.org does not charge a fixed commission to buyers or sellers. All Originators' Rewards and ownership Future Rewards are calculated based on the seller's profit.&#x20;
2. **Get paid even after you sell the token:** The Future Rewards framework shares a percentage of the realized profit with the Giving Circle that makes up the chain of ownership after you sell the token.
3. **On-chain royalty payments:** the artists' royalty payments are part of the Originators' Rewards (ORs) on untrading.org. They are immutable and on-chain. The nFRn framework discourages buyers and sellers from circumventing royalty payments.&#x20;
4. **On-chain NFT licenses:** untrading.org implements the "Can't Be Evil" NFT licenses released by a16z on its native smart contract. Creators can choose from six on-chain licenses that outline respective rights and obligations.

<summary>What are the benefits of using untrading.org?</summary>

There is no commission charged on each transaction on the platform, and there is no conflict of interest between the platform and its users; each trading asset creates a giving circle that benefits the platform users in three ways:&#x20;

1. You will continue to receive Future Rewards (FRs) after the token is sold;&#x20;
2. There is no transaction cost (other than the gas cost associated with various blockchains) if the trade (buying and selling) is not profitable;&#x20;
3. On-chain Originators Rewards (royalty payments) that cannot be changed arbitrarily by the platform;&#x20;
4. a16z's "Can't Be Evil" NFT licenses are implemented on untrading.org for Artwork items.

<summary>Surely untrading can help me earn more in the long run, and how can it prevent me from losing money?</summary>

There is **NO** way to prevent anyone from losing money in trading. No losses should be socialized or bailed out either. Trading always involves risk. The only way to "prevent" risks and losses is either not to trade or join a Ponzi scheme.

Even though there are no guarantees in trading, the platform can help you cope if you lose in a trade since there will be no fees or commissions. Moreover, regardless of your not contributing to the former owners, you will still receive Future Rewards (FRs) from the Giving Circle if the future owners make money trading this NFT as a result of your position in the chain of ownership.

<summary><strong>Ownership of tokens is rewarded, but why?</strong></summary>

The provenance of artworks and collectibles strongly influences their value. A token's price discovery process is influenced by all buyers, especially at the early stages of its trading lifecycle. In the spirit of open-source gift economy, it is fair to reward all the former owners retrospectively for adding value to the token's price increases during the process.&#x20;

Similarly, tokenizible assets gain value when each former owner shares the same growth goals as the present owner, forming a healthy community.

<summary><strong>If untrading.org doesn't charge commissions, how does it make money?</strong></summary>

Through eliminating transaction fees, untrading.org prevents conflicts of interest between its users and the platform.&#x20;

For the platform to generate revenue, users must make a profit. The Originators' Rewards (ORs), representing originators', creators', and artists' lifetime royalty income, are split between them and untrading.org (for example, 70/30, but currently 100/0). The platform's only revenue comes from this. OR payments are made on-chain and are based on the seller's profit, not the sale price.

<summary><strong>What is a Giftchain?</strong></summary>

By utilizing EIP-5173, creators, buyers, and sellers of tokens form on-chain communities we call Giftchains. Giftchains are formed when participants work together to increase wealth. A Giftchain is a decentralized, on-chain community made up of all the buyers and sellers of an NFT token.

The owners are arranged in a queue, starting with the earliest owner and ending with the owner immediately before the current owner (the Last Generation). The First Generation is the last of the next n generations. There is a fixed-size profit distribution window from the First Generation to the Last Generation.

Those who sell non-fungible-future-reward-compliant tokens (nFR tokens) will share profits if they are not the original minters, the Originator, and therefore not the very first sellers in the chain. Future Rewards (FRs) create a trustless, on-chain Giving Circle that is governed by the original smart contract by making sure that every seller, regardless of position, gives and receives the Future Reward distributions specified by the Originator when the token was minted.

With this new NFT framework, stronger communities can be created and mutually beneficial relationships can be formed. Giving Circles are living communities where previous and current owners share interests.

<summary>How safe is untrading protocol?</summary>

untrading.org is a non-custodial platform without counterparty risk that allows users to retain control of their assets even in the event of bankruptcy through asset-unlocking smart contracts signed jointly by the platform, users, and an outside custodian.

To make the framework robust and resilient, the untrading.org protocol does not promise a fixed rate of reward to anyone at any time. While the exact amount and timing of the rewards is uncertain, the on-chain mechanism for distributing these rewards is immutable.&#x20;

untrading.org also includes measures to protect user assets, such as asset-unlocking contracts signed by users, the protocol, and a third-party custodian. User funds are safe even in the event of untrading.org ceases to exist.
