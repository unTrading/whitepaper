# üéÅ a giftchain

<mark style="color:red;">**more for you is also more for me‚Ñ¢**</mark>



Our goal at untrading.org is to cultivate a virtuous economic environment for the financial sector.

The untrading.org platform enables users to participate in a gift economy based on [EIP-5173](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5173) published in June 2022 by iob.fi DAO. Although it is not a charity or philanthropic endeavor, it helps all of its users - the creators, buyers, and sellers - as well as the platform's stakeholders build greater wealth through each other's success. There is no longer a zero-sum game when it comes to trading.

### Creating greater value through community

In game theory, a zero-sum situation occurs when one party's gain equals another's loss, resulting in a net change in wealth or benefit being zero. A financial instrument such as an option or a futures contract is a zero-sum game with transaction costs. Every contract has a winner and a loser.&#x20;

Unlike zero-sum games, win-win situations benefit both parties. That is a non-zero-sum game in which one party's victory does not necessarily mean another's loss.&#x20;

Win-win situations benefit all parties collectively.
