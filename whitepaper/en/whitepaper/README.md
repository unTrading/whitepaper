In one short sentence:

> _"**untrading.org creates trustless Flows that eliminate zero-sum mentality and conflicts of interest in trading.**"_

A Flow is a decentralized profit loopback sharing ecosystem consisting of a defined number of NFT token buyers and sellers. Each untrading token forms its own Flow.

Built on a DeFi protocol with the implementation of non-fungible Future Rewards (nFR) architecture, the Giftchain aims to eliminate the zero-sum mentality of trading by creating more value together, rather than for one individual to gain at the expense of another, thereby ending a vicious cycle that sees traders lose everything in six to 24 months.

In more detail, here is what untrading.org is all about:

> _‚Äú**untrading.org implements Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-5173), which eliminates conflicts of interest and ends zero-sum mentality currently practiced by all exchanges by creating a trustless Flows for each token among creators, buyers, and sellers using an improved NFT framework.**‚Äù_

The buyers/owners receive a portion of the realized profit from an NFT transaction. The remaining proceeds go to the seller.

The owners are arranged in a queue, starting with the earliest owner and ending with the owner immediately before the current owner (the Last Generation). The First Generation is the last of the next n generations. There is a fixed-size profit distribution window from the First Generation to the Last Generation.&#x20;

The profit distribution shall be only available to previous owners who fall within the window. &#x20;

## **untrading.org in** 200 Words

The following is a more comprehensive description that includes several key elements of the new trading platform architecture:

> Through the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), untrading.org has released an [Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-5173)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5173) to promote a more cooperative and inclusive (un)trading environment.&#x20;
>
> This proposal and its implementation, [the untrading.org protocol](https://untrading.org), aim to align the interests of users and the protocol by eliminating transaction fees and encouraging a gift economy in which successful traders share their profits with previous owners, resulting in a Giftchain ecosystem where more for you is also more for me.&#x20;
>
> Non-fungible Future Rewards (nFR) aims to break the traditional pattern in which most traders, except for a very small minority of highly disciplined,  lose everything within a few months to small groups of people who are in the position of control and influence.&#x20;
>
> To make the framework robust and resilient, the untrading.org protocol does not promise a fixed rate of reward to anyone at any time. While the exact amount and timing of the rewards is uncertain, the on-chain mechanism for distributing these rewards is immutable.&#x20;
>
> untrading.org also includes measures to protect user assets, such as asset-unlocking contracts signed by users, the protocol, and a third-party custodian. User funds are safe even in the event of untrading.org ceases to exist.

The paper will discuss the foundations of the untrading protocol. A number of new financial innovations have recently emerged, but not all of them offer the same features as untrading.org.

## Abstract

iob.fi DAO aims to end the conflict of interest between platforms and their users and the zero-sum nature of trading.

With the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-5173) we published in June 2022, the untrading.org platform aims to address the disadvantages currently facing creators and investors alike. The new ‚Äúanti-trading‚Äù platform creates an on-chain and multisig-smart-contract-enforced trustless Giftchain among creators, buyers, and sellers of NFTs and their derivatives, eliminating conflicts of interest and ending the zero-sum nature of trading currently being practiced by all exchanges.

Through the implementation of EIP-5173, the creators, buyers and sellers create a Giftchain in trading practice. A Giftchain is formed when all participants work in a framework to build greater wealth through each other's success.&#x20;

Our open-source philosophy embraces and promotes a new gift economic model that is similar to Copyleft and open-source, as opposed to traditional copyrights. The advancement of technology has enabled such implementation in trading for the first time. In the same way that open-source software has changed the software industry and society, we can also change the financial industry.

untrading.org is dedicated to developing trading solutions that deliver nothing short of a completely new decentralized finance model that breaks free from centuries of unfair practices favored by a few and financial ruin for many. Future Rewards is a framework designed to help traders change this.

The idea behind untrading.org is to shift the focus from win at any costs to collaboration and community-wide wealth creation. This is achieved by implementing a new set of rules and incentives that encourage (un)traders to work together and share a fixed portion of the ever-growing gains. The goal of EIP-5173 is to create a more equitable and sustainable (un)trading ecosystem, where **more for you is also more for me**.

### **Phase One, Q3-Q4 2022**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-26 08.33.11.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Future Rewards

In EIP-5173, a multigenerational reward mechanism of a Giftchain that rewards‚Äå all ‚Äåowners of non-fungible tokens (NFT), the Future Rewards (FR) extension is introduced that will allow owners of unNFT tokens to participate in future investment profits derived from the same token by later investors in the same chain of ownership. For more details, see Section 2.3.

In Phase One, we intend to allow trading of original artworks ("untrading", as we don't encourage active trading"), as well as derivatives based on blue-chip NFTs that were originally minted and sold on other platforms. To participate in the FR system, existing ERC721 tokens can be upgraded to the new unNFT-class EIP-5173 token standard.&#x20;

#### **Enhanced** value creation **for both buyers and sellers**

With no commissions, deposit fees, transfer fees, or withdrawal fees, untrading.org offers enhanced value creation for both buyers and sellers. In addition, the unique gift economic framework allows owners of unNFTs to benefit from an increase in price during their holding period and continue to receive Future Rewards (FRs) even after the token is sold.&#x20;

Furthermore, the realized profits from the sale of unNFTs will be shared across the chain of historical ownership through the NFT Future Rewards (nFR) framework, forming a Giftchain. The untrading.org protocol also introduces an improved on-chain, cross-platform royalty payment mechanism with the introduction of an o-token. Overall, the untrading.org system offers a win-win situation for all involved, with sellers only responsible for royalties and Future Rewards when they make a profit.

The royalty portion of the profit-sharing plan will be partially based on [EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) \[1] and some functionalities in the draft proposal of [EIP-4910](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/actions/runs/2174511329) \[2]. The untrading.org protocol will implement an improved on-chain, cross-platform royalty payment mechanism with the introduction of an o-token.

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-26 08.35.57.png" alt="" data-size="original">

#### Creating greater value through community

Unlike traditional financial instruments that result in a zero-sum game, where one party's gain equals another's loss, untrading.org offers a unique win-win situation. Through the use of the gift economic framework and the introduction of the o-token, all parties involved in the sale of unNFTs can benefit. The seller receives the realized profit, and both the seller and previous owners receive Future Rewards (FRs) through the NFT Future Rewards (nFR) framework.&#x20;

This creates a non-zero-sum game where one party's victory does not necessarily mean another's loss, resulting in a net increase in wealth and benefits for all parties involved.

#### **It is also possible to consider anyone as a creator**

As with the artists and creators, anyone who mints an unNFT token is considered the Minter on the untrading.org platform. In addition to perpetual royalty payments, they can receive Future Rewards from the future generations of owners they designate by wrapping their own NFT token into an unNFT.

**unBTC, unETH and more**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-26 08.38.02.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Along with unNFTs, we will add cryptocurrency and other derivatives to the platform.&#x20;

By wrapping bitcoins into FR-compliant unBTC tokens on a 1:1 value, for example, untrading.org allows users to receive the same amount as the original BTC as well as royalties and Future Rewards.

A number of other top cryptocurrencies will also be included.

## <mark style="color:red;">01</mark>        Introduction <a href="#h.5php9w692ai5" id="h.5php9w692ai5"></a>

The untrading.org protocol is a revolutionary investment and (un)trading platform that sets itself apart from others by not encouraging constant and frequent trading activities to generate fees. Instead, untrading.org charges no commissions, no deposit fees, no transfer fees, or withdrawal fees, providing a fair and transparent platform for all parties involved. This avoids conflicts of interest and allows for a more equitable distribution of benefits, resulting in a win-win situation for buyers, sellers, and previous owners. With untrading.org, everyone can benefit from the sale of unNFTs without the need for constant trading and high fees.

#### Why Do People Trade?

It is a common misconception that trading is an easy way to get rich quickly with little effort, even though they would not attempt to perform their own open heart surgery. In reality, the majority of traders lose money in the markets. Despite this, trading platforms and their promoters often portray trading as a simple path to wealth, leading many people to believe that they can make easy money through trading.

There are several reasons why this misconception persists among the general public. One reason is the prevalence of marketing and advertising materials that depict trading as a lucrative and easy way to make money. Additionally, the rise of online trading platforms and mobile apps has made it easier for people to access the markets, leading to an influx of inexperienced traders who may not fully understand the risks involved in trading to be ‚Äúempowered‚Äù with loads of charts, data and strategies that make them think they are now capable of playing in the big league. Another factor is the appeal of the idea of being able to achieve financial independence and control one's own income, which can be particularly attractive to those who are confident and smart in their own fields.&#x20;

Studies have shown that this overconfidence bias is particularly prevalent in the realm of finance and trading. In fact, research has shown that over 60% of people consistently rank themselves in the top 5% of investors, despite the fact that only a small percentage of traders actually achieve this level of success.

People are influenced by the stories of the biggest winners in the markets. These stories are often featured in the media and can make it seem like anyone can achieve similar success.

However, it is important to remember that the stories of the biggest winners in the markets are not representative of the average trader. These individuals are often exceptionally skilled and experienced traders who have been able to achieve success through years of hard work and dedication.

In addition, the success of these traders is often due to a combination of skill and luck. While their skill may have helped them to make the right decisions, they may also have benefited from fortunate market conditions or other factors that were outside of their control.

As a result, it is not accurate to say that "if they can do it, so can you." Trading is a complex and challenging activity, and achieving success in the markets requires a significant amount of effort and expertise.

Yet, another reason why people choose to trade financial markets on their own is that they do not trust financial institutions. There have been numerous scandals involving financial institutions engaging in unethical or illegal behavior in order to boost their profits. This leads to a loss of trust in the financial system and makes people hesitant to entrust their money to financial institutions. Additionally, some people may be wary of the potential for conflicts of interest and high fees associated with working with financial institutions. In these cases, people may choose to trade financial markets on their own in order to avoid these potential drawbacks and have more control over their investment decisions.

While over 90% of traders lose in the markets, trading platforms and their promoters continue to portray trading as an easy way to get rich quickly. Financial market trading has been a zero sum game and the primary function of financial markets is to transfer wealth from the masses to the few. This adds to the challenges of trading and makes it more difficult for traders to succeed.

#### EIP-5173

EIP-5173, proposed by untrading.org, is a proposed protocol for a new approach to (un)trading that aims to address the zero-sum mentality that has long been prevalent in the financial industry. The goal of untrading.org is to create a more cooperative and mutually beneficial (un)trading and investment environment, where everyone can benefit from the success of the market as a whole.&#x20;

This paper is organized into five sections. The remainder of this introduction provides a brief history of the current financial trading system and explains why trading can be considered a zero-sum game. The introduction then discusses why on-chain, trustless Giftchains can be created to end both the conflicts of interest between exchanges and their users, and as a way of ending the zero-sum game and converting it into a positive-sum game, and the use cases We describe and analyze the architecture of untrading.org in section 2. In section 3, the specific functions and mathematical formula for Future Rewards distribution are described in detail, along with the open-source Solidity code. In section 4, we discuss the security risks and fundamental challenges facing untrading.org. We also discuss specific vulnerabilities that could make this entire business concept useless if not addressed properly. A short summary concludes the paper in section 5.

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.1</mark>        Philosophy <a href="#h.kplu6gt7s2fs" id="h.kplu6gt7s2fs"></a>

> _Under capitalism, man exploits man. Under communism, it‚Äôs just the opposite._&#x20;
>
> ‚Äî John Kenneth Galbraith

Despite its best intentions and designs, a planned economy will fail because it is a complex system whose future cannot be predicted.

It sounds great on paper, but a totally free-rein economy is vulnerable to abuses and local manipulations, so there is no true market economy. Even with heavy government regulations, the free market economy often suffers regular cycles of busts and bumps that destroy lives, destroy pensions, and cause significant social damage. The quantitative easings (QEs) and government bailouts of banks that are "too big to fail" are prime examples of why there is no true market economy.

The current economic and financial systems do not adequately address the interconnectedness and uniqueness of human beings, and as a result, they fail to prioritize true human well-being, happiness, connectedness, fairness, equality, and fulfillment. We need a new vision for a money system and economy that takes these factors into account and provides a framework for achieving these goals.

The evolution of biology and human society has been marked by a constant increase in connectivity. From the earliest forms of life, which were likely single-celled organisms, to the complex ecosystems of today, living beings have developed intricate networks of interactions and dependencies. As humans evolved, they formed increasingly complex societies, characterized by greater levels of cooperation, communication, and connection. However, the evolution of modern society and its economy and markets have followed a different path. In recent times, we have seen a trend towards greater separation and fragmentation.&#x20;

In spite of living closer to one another physically in cities, people are increasingly isolated and isolated from one another. It is hailed and praised as an accomplishment when a businessperson or market participant maximizes their profit at all costs. In the past decades, automation and technology have largely led to the concentration of wealth in a few hands, and large corporations have replaced small businesses.

There are profound implications to this divergence between the evolution of biology and traditional human society on the one hand, and the evolution of contemporary society and its economy on the other. In the face of challenges such as disease or environmental change, increased connectivity increases biological resilience and adaptability. However, modern economies and markets are becoming increasingly separate, making them more susceptible to shocks and crises. In order to build a more sustainable and equitable future, we must recognize and address this divergence.&#x20;

Since the creation of financial exchanges in their modern format several hundred years ago, the purpose of the market has been to transfer wealth from the masses to the privileged few. In today's market, a few people with significant influence are constantly manipulating and abusing it. Individuals and businesses are becoming increasingly isolated and disconnected from one another as they focus on their own interests and goals. We have reached an unsustainable level of conflict between platforms and their customers, as well as between users themselves.

Despite these challenges, however, there is still hope for a more connected and inclusive society. As technology continues to evolve and advance, it is likely that new forms of communication and interaction will emerge that will help bridge the gap between people and businesses. At the same time, the increasing awareness of the need for greater connectivity and collaboration may also inspire people to come together and work towards a more inclusive and connected society.

People freely give and receive gifts in a gift economy without any expectation of immediate or specific compensation, which is one of the "primitive" economic structures that led humanity to positive growth. The non-quantifiable elements omitted in the current economic theories that are often the true indicator of the quality of life, the motivation to give and contribute, can contribute to the sense of community and connection that people are motivated to create.

The use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help facilitate and record these transactions, providing a decentralized and transparent system for tracking gifts and their recipients. NFTs can also be used to create unique and rare digital assets, adding value and incentive for participation in the gift economy.

Additionally, the nonhierarchical nature of the gift economy can foster a more inclusive and equitable society, as power dynamics and hierarchies are minimized. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and happiness, as individuals are able to contribute and receive based on their unique skills and abilities.

Overall, the return of the gift economy, supported by a decentralized and enhanced NFT framework, can provide a sustainable and fulfilling alternative to traditional economic models.

EIP-5173: NFT Future Rewards (nFR), a multigenerational reward mechanism that rewards all owners of non-fungible tokens (NFT), was drafted and published under these guiding principles, creating a new economic paradigm where **more for you is also more for me** ‚Ñ¢.&#x20;

In this application, it involves implementing the fundamental gift economy principles in a practical manner, which results in the overall good of the community when each member acts in their own self-interest.

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.2</mark>        History <a href="#h.kplu6gt7s2fs" id="h.kplu6gt7s2fs"></a>

The current financial system is designed to make people lose money. It is common for an average trader to fall victim to spoofing, insider trading, front running, wash trading, and pump and dump, among a number of other techniques used by various actors. The current system guarantees that most of you will lose money because of your emotions, the constant oscillation between greed and fear. Under the current system, a trader has no advantage over many of the more sophisticated techniques used by various actors.

You are required to contribute to the payment of various fees, including commissions, margin fees, interest, markups, funding fees, deposit fees, transfer fees, and withdrawal fees, regardless of whether you are a winner or a loser.&#x20;

Trading is designed in such a way that only the platforms and a few insiders benefit. Several hundred years ago, the trade of financial instruments, in its current form, was developed in Europe to enable commodity and financial markets, but the structure of the system resulted in the centuries of wealth transfer from the masses to an elite who exercised political and commercial control. It is estimated that ninety percent of traders lost a majority or all of their trading capital as a result of their participation.

If you have been doing some trading, you know that markets are historically designed to transfer wealth to the wealthiest:

* The exchange that charges transaction fees is acting in its own interest first, and its customers second;
* Exchange rules are designed to maximize profits;
* Most traders lose money in the long run;
* The 3% commission DeFi model simply automates and extends the historic imbalance.

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.3</mark>       Rationale <a href="#h.2hsns6abcaef" id="h.2hsns6abcaef"></a>

Although this historical precedent has been followed in today's markets, just as crypto has revolutionized traditional trading, we now have the opportunity to transform this historic trail of unequal value distribution by tracking every transaction of every distinguishable token through the emergence of the non-fungible token standard.

There needs to be a change in historical unfair trading practices so that:&#x20;

* There needs to be a change in historical unfair trading practices so that: With a success-based model, everyone is on the same page;
* Exchanges only generate revenue when users make money;
* A mutually beneficial economic rule benefits both buyers and sellers;
* Traders are encouraged to do the right thing instead of ‚Äúbuying, selling, and buying.‚Äù

It is appropriate and fair for artists and creators to be compensated for both the sale price and appreciation in the value of their creation with a lifetime royalty exercised in future sales, similar to the recording industry's practice of decades ago. New buyers and owners of artworks will not be required to pay a fee until the artwork has been sold and they have made a profit from it. In a Giftchain, art buyers/owners are compensated for their participation in the instrument‚Äôs trading price discovery process.

Most traders have lost money over a period of months or years. Without considering the fairness of that system, the Giftchain created by the proposed Future Rewards framework can alleviate some of the burdens of an average trader.

Therefore, we present untrading.org, where all interests are aligned, the platform, the buyers, and the sellers, creating a positive gift economy that rewards and incentivizes all parties fairly and equally.

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.4</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>       To Invest or to Trade? <a href="#h.s6ava0wuzykt" id="h.s6ava0wuzykt"></a>

Are you looking to invest in something that may be valuable in the future and acquire it early? Great! In reality, you often find yourself in a situation where the price keeps rising regardless of whether you are a diamond hand hodler or a paper hand trader.

But what if you could also be rewarded for your contribution to the chain of ownership of a collectible/asset and future price increases following the sale of your NFT? With the Giftchain, you can! Our unique system ensures that all parties are fairly compensated for their contributions to the trading process. Check out Table 1 in Section 2.2 for a detailed explanation of how it works.

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.5</mark>        The Best of Both Worlds <a href="#h.yd1vx9c6epoc" id="h.yd1vx9c6epoc"></a>

With the Giftchain, you are never encouraged nor pressured to trade in order to generate platform fees. You can hold onto your high quality assets as long as you want, and if you choose to sell them ‚Äì whether you need the funds or you believe the market is about to crash ‚Äì you will still receive a portion of the future profits if the price keeps increasing.

It's the best of both worlds: the flexibility and control of traditional trading, combined with the rewards and benefits of a lifetime royalty system. Join the Giftchain and start enjoying the best of both worlds today!

#### Introducing Giftchains <a href="#h.x5hek4s7c18r" id="h.x5hek4s7c18r"></a>

The Giftchain framework is a revolutionary new investment and (un)trading protocol that offers the best of both worlds.

With the Giftchain, you can be part of a community of people who work together to improve a situation that is typically much larger than it is at the moment. Some of the characteristics of a Giftchain are community interdependence and delayed reciprocity.

Unlike traditional trading platforms, the Giftchain operates on a system of giving and receiving, where you do not expect the same amount of return from the same person when you give them a portion of your profits. There is no quid pro quo. Rather, you can be confident that someone else in the same circle will give you the same benefits, with a smaller or greater monetary value, from other participants in the same circle later on.

In a well-designed circle of giving, givers may be able to receive more than they give over time, so giving is not the only thing involved. As a result, the traditional model of platform versus user and user vs. user relationships has been fundamentally altered into one, shared objective: if others succeed, I succeed more.

Join the Giftchain and be part of a new, more equitable and fair trading system today!

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.6</mark>        Only Pay after You Have Realized a Profit <a href="#h.x5hek4s7c18r" id="h.x5hek4s7c18r"></a>

At untrading.org, we believe that trading platforms should not charge their users for losses. Instead, we apply an incentive fee model based on the idea of hedge funds, where a user only pays if the transaction is profitable.

Unlike other platforms, the Giftchain  does not charge commissions, deposit fees, transfer fees, or withdrawal fees. We generate revenue by sharing a small part of a user's profit with the Minters as the o-token holders.

This not only makes trading more fair and equitable, but it also discourages any "under-the-table" deals that may circumvent the rules set forth by artists, creators, and marketplaces. Join the Giftchain and experience a new way of trading, where you only pay after you have realized a profit.

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.7</mark>        Use Cases <a href="#h.o4p39l4e3q7k" id="h.o4p39l4e3q7k"></a>

#### **Original NFT**

Users can mint and list artworks on untrading.org to receive two types of tokens simultaneously, the unNFT tokens for trading and the unlisted o-tokens for receiving royalty payments. Minters receive additional Future Rewards distributions if they sell their unNFTs as first generation owners.

#### **Third-party NFT wrapping**

The untrading.org platform allows users to wrap existing NFTs they have purchased from any other marketplace and upgrade them into unNFTs. Minters who wrap the existing NFTs are now both the originators and owners on the untrading.org platform and will receive both the new royalty payments and the FR distributions.

#### **Applications**

The untrading.org script language will allow the development of applications to handle a wide range of trading capabilities, including trading on centralized and decentralized marketplaces, derivative issuance, and trading handled by regulated transfer agents, among others. This allows any unNFT to be traded on third-party marketplaces and exchanges.

#### **Content Curation**

Users of untrading.org can gather around collections, styles, and art movements of shared interests.

#### **Social**

Groups that currently gather in online forums, chat groups, online trading analytical websites, or even other centralized marketplaces could port their communities into untrading.org.

#### **Financial derivatives**

Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SOL can be upgraded into un-token standard derivatives on untrading.org. In addition, other traditional financial assets, such as stocks, real estate, and any other quoted securities, may also be converted into derivatives by utilizing third-party custodians and transfer agents. &#x20;

#### **Other user cases**

As there are no technical specifications governing what can be wrapped for listing and trading on untrading.org, there may be additional use cases involving upgrading the startup funding methods. The founders of startup projects may use untrading.org to raise funds. The founders, team members, and advisors receive o-tokens, but only the paying investors receive un-tokens. The team is considered the Minter, and will receive royalties perpetually from the success of the project whenever an un-token holder, the investor, makes a profit.

The investors' confidence in the new funding increases since the founders' financial incentives are truly linked to the investor's profitability, in addition, rug-pulling is prevented.

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.8</mark>        Definitions <a href="#h.o4p39l4e3q7k" id="h.o4p39l4e3q7k"></a>

**Non-fungible Future Reward Protocol (nFR):** Also known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-5173), nFR is an ERC721 token extension that  enables owners of EIP-721 tokens (NFTs) to participate in future price increases after they sell their tokens, resulting in more for you is also more for me.

**Giftchain:** Each unNFT token under EIP-5173 has its own Giftchains, a unique "mini community" consists of its previous and current owners. Every cryptocurrency pair has its own Giftchain, so unNFT tokens can have multiple Giftchains. Each member gives and receives Future Rewards (FRs) generated by the new trading profits of each token.

**Minting:** Minting on untrading.org is to create an nFR-compliant unNFT. In the same way as any other NFT minting process, the art piece is minted as an NFT with an additional asset called o-tokens that are distributed to the Minter and untrading.org for receiving royalties (ORs) from unNFT profits.

**Wrapping:** Untrading.org offers wrapping for blue-chip NFT upgrades from third parties. In addition to artists and creators minting their artwork on the protocol, anyone can wrap an existing valuable NFT they bought from any marketplace they have in their collection as an unNFT of the same value, backed by the original NFT, on untrading.org as an unNFT of the same value. The procedure is enhanced by additional steps and safekeeping measures.

**Rewards (R):** A portion of the net profit from the sale of an unNFT is set aside for Future Rewards sharing. This is called Rewards (R). The remainder is the seller's profit.

**o-token:** Aside from listed tokens, o-tokens also are issued to artists if they are minting or wrapping an NFT on untrading.org. Owners of o-tokens are entitled to receive royalties.&#x20;

**Originators‚Äô Rewards (ORs):** The Rewards (R) are divided into two portions: For the profits distributed to Minters and former owners. As a result, the artists will receive a fixed portion of all future owners' profits, known as the Originator Rewards (OR). The remaining profits are shared with previous owners and buyers, known as the Future Rewards (FR).&#x20;

**un-token:** An NFT token minted on untrading.org under EIP-5173. It bears a prefix of ‚Äúun.‚Äù

**Future Rewards (FRs):** A multigenerational reward mechanism of Giftchains that rewards‚Äå all ‚Äåowners of non-fungible tokens (NFT), the Future Rewards (FR) extension is introduced that will allow owners of unNFT tokens to participate in future investment profits derived from the same token by later investors in the same chain of ownership. R minus OR is the remainder of the buyers', or owners', Future Rewards.

**Generations:** The numbered sequence of the current and previous token owners within the sliding window mechanism (n) that are currently eligible for FRs distribution. It determines which previous owners will receive distributions. The owners are arranged in a queue, starting with the earliest owner and ending with the owner immediately before the current owner (the Last Generation). The First Generation is the last of the next n generations. There is a fixed-size profit distribution window from the First Generation to the Last Generation. The sliding window (w) itself is called an Epoch.&#x20;

**Total nFR Paid:** The number of ORs and FRs an active un-token has generated for its creator, all previous owners, and its current owner. In contrast to the traditional Daily Volume and Total Trading Volume that are mostly self-serving exchange metrics, the Total nFR Paid is one of the most important protocol success metrics for untrading.org. This metric is listed on every minted unNFT details page.

## <mark style="color:red;">02</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>       Architecture <a href="#h.dn642dhamgzt" id="h.dn642dhamgzt"></a>

For each listed token, the untrading.org protocol consists of two or three tokens: 1) the main listed un-token, and it is always accompanied by 2) the unlisted minter, or creator token, the o-token, and 3) if the un-token is backed by an existing third-party NFT the Minter owns, the third-party NFT locked in the escrow contract‚Äôs multisig, multi-party vault.

### <mark style="color:blue;">2.1</mark>        The o-tokens <a href="#h.v2ngx7e84l7r" id="h.v2ngx7e84l7r"></a>

Aside from listed tokens, o-tokens also are issued to artists if they are minting an original NFT, and to the owner of a blue-chip NFT as the Minter on untrading.org. Owners of o-tokens are entitled to receive royalties.

A portion of the net profit from the sale of an unNFT is set aside for Future Rewards sharing. This is called Rewards (R). The remainder is the seller's profit.

Additionally, the Rewards (R) are divided into two (2) portions: For the profits distributed to Minters and former owners. As a result, the artists will receive a fixed portion of all future owners' profits, known as the Originator Rewards (OR). The remaining profits are shared with previous owners and buyers, known as the Future Rewards (FR).

Within these ranges, the Minter can set the total Rewards ratio and the Originator Reward ratio:

| Rewards (R) ratio of total Profit | _f_ | 5% - 50% |
| --------------------------------- | --- | -------: |
| Originator Reward (OR) ratio      | _a_ | 5% - 50% |

Although it is the Minter's privilege to set these ratios, setting these ratios too high or too low may make the unNFT undesirable to potential purchasers.

* Default values for f and a when minting original art unNFTs are 35% and 60%, respectively;
* NFT wrapping uses f as 15% and a as 20% by default.

### <mark style="color:blue;">2.2</mark>        The un-tokens <a href="#h.jil64evym007" id="h.jil64evym007"></a>

As a result of the minting process described below, untrading.org non-fungible tokens bear a prefix of "un."

R minus OR is the remainder of the buyers', or owners', Future Rewards.

#### **Future Rewards calculation**&#x20;

The Minter can also define a sliding window mechanism to decide which previous owners will be involved in the profit distribution. Let's imagine the owners as a queue starting from the firsthand owner to the current owner. The profit distribution window starts from the previous owner immediately to the current owner and extends towards the first owner, and the size of the windows is fixed. Only previous owners located inside the window will join the profit distribution. &#x20;

The total number of generations of owners in the sliding window is set by the Minter.

| Generations of Owners receiving FRs | _w_ | 5 - 20 |
| ----------------------------------- | --- | -----: |

* The default value of w is 10.

#### **Rewards formula**

![Rewards formula](../.gitbook/assets/image4.png)

In this equation:

* P is the total profit;
* _f_ is reward ratio
* _r_ is buyer reward ratio of the total P
* _a_ is originator reward ratio
* _b_ is buyer reward ratio of the total P, and b = 1 ‚Äì a
* w is the window size, i.e. the maximum number of layers eligible for profit distribution
* _g_ is the common ratio of successive in the geometric sequence
* _m_ is the total number of all owners of a token
* _n_ is the actual number of owners eligible in the profit distributions. To calculate the formula value of _n_, we have _n_ = min(_m, w_), and _w_ is the window size of the profit distribution sliding window algorithm, , set by the Minter when minting the unNFT.

The buyers/owners receive a portion ( _r_ ) of the realized profit  (P ) from an NFT transaction. The remaining proceeds go to the seller.

As a result of defining a sliding window mechanism ( _n_ ), we can determine which previous owners will receive distributions. The owners are arranged in a queue, starting with the earliest owner and ending with the owner immediately before the current owner (the Last Generation). The First Generation is the last of the next n generations. There is a fixed-size profit distribution window from the First Generation to the Last Generation.

The profit distribution shall be only available to previous owners who fall within the window. &#x20;

![Figure 1: Geometric sequence distribution](../.gitbook/assets/image3.png)

In the example in _Figure 1_, there is a portion of the proceeds awarded to the Last Generation owner (the owner immediately prior to the current seller) based on the geometric sequence in which profits are distributed. The larger portion of the proceeds shall go to the Mid-Gen owners, the earlier the greater, until the last eligible owner is determined by the sliding window, the First Generation. Owners who purchase earlier will receive a greater reward, with first-generation owners receiving the greatest reward.

**Price history example**

_Figure. 2_ and _Table 1_ illustrate the price history of a 10-generation distribution unNFT token. We will examine the sharing and receiving of FRs by Owner #3.

![Figure 2: An example of price history of an unNFT](../.gitbook/assets/image10.png)

Owning the token for $200, selling it for $400, and then sharing the $200 profit with the creator/minter, untrading.org, the o-token holders collectively, as ORs, and Owner #2 and #1 as FRs is your responsibility when you are Owner #3. As of Owner #6, all transactions have been sold and purchased at lower prices. This price is the highest ever for a period of time. Until Owner #6, no transactions had been sold or bought at lower prices. This is the highest price ever for a period of time.

|           |        |
| --------- | -----: |
| Owner     |  Price |
| Owner #10 | $1,000 |
| Owner #9  |   $700 |
| Owner #8  |   $600 |
| Owner #7  |   $450 |
| Owner #6  |    $60 |
| Owner #5  |    $70 |
| Owner #4  |    $50 |
| Owner #3  |   $400 |
| Owner #2  |   $200 |
| Owner #1  |   $100 |

_Table 1: Price History_

Owning the token for $200, selling it for $400, and then sharing the $200 profit with the creator/minter, untrading.org, the o-token holders collectively, as ORs, and Owner #2 and #1 as FRs is your responsibility when you are Owner #3. As of Owner #6, all transactions have been sold and purchased at lower prices. This price is the highest ever for a period of time. Until Owner #6, no transactions had been sold or bought at lower prices. This is the highest price ever for a period of time.

Owner #4 purchased for $400, sold to Owner #5 for $50 at a loss. Owner #4 will not be paying any buying or selling commissions. They do not pay any royalty to the o-token holders or FRs to Owner #1, #2 or you, #3 as they lost money. Owner #5 purchased the unNFT for $50 and sold it for $70. A royalty payment will be made to the holders of the o-tokens and FRs will be provided to Owner #1, #2, you, and Owner #4, although the amount is quite small.

Owner #6 also lost money, but it was a smaller loss than owner #4's. This sale does not pay out to anyone.

It was, however, a great success for Owner #7. Their purchase of the property was for $60 and subsequently sold for $450, an all-time high (ATH). Based on their profit of $390, they will pay royalties to the o-token holders and all the unNFT token holders before them: Owners #1, #2, you, #4, #5, and #6. &#x20;

In the event that the unNFT continues to make ATHs, any new profits realized by the new owners, #7, #8, #9, and #10, will be shared with all the previous generations of owners, including yourself.

Even for Owner #4, the biggest loser in our example, the FRs received from #5, #7, #8, #9, and #10 could be substantial.

See Table 2 in the Specification section for a detailed illustration.

### <mark style="color:blue;">2.3</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>       Minting <a href="#h.ocqixsbeplyi" id="h.ocqixsbeplyi"></a>

On untrading.org, users can mint original artwork or wrap existing NFTs into nFR-compliant unNFTs.

_Figure 3_ shows how an original piece is minted on untrading.org as an nFR-compliant unNFT. In the same way as any other NFT minting process, this art piece is minted as an NFT with an additional asset called o- tokens that are distributed to the Minter and untrading.org for receiving royalties from unNFT profits.

#### **Original NFT Minting**

![Figure 3: Original NFT minting](../.gitbook/assets/unNFT\_wrapping.jpg)

Royalties and platform‚Äôs share are as follows:

| Minter's share of OR        | _b_ | 70% |
| --------------------------- | --- | --: |
| untrading.org's share of OR |     | 30% |

untrading.org receives a small number of o- tokens from each unNFT minted on the platform. This is the only financial benefit the platform receives.

#### **Third-party blue-chip NFT Wrapping**

![Figure 4: 3rd-party NFT wrapping](../.gitbook/assets/3rd-party\_unNFT\_minting.jpg)

In addition for an artist and creator to mint their artwork on the platform, anyone can wrap an existing valuable NFT they bought from any marketplace in their collection on untrading.org as an unNFT of the same value, backed by the original NFT  (See _Figure 4_). Additional steps and safe-keeping measures are implemented.

**Pre-approved collections**

Untrading.org sets a list of pre-approved collections that we allow for wrapping and derivative trading during beta testing.

By wrapping an existing blue-chip NFT on the untrading.org platform, the smart contract will check and authenticate that it is in its pre-approved collections.

**Custody of the original NFTs**

When a user wraps their third-party existing NFT into an unNFT, the NFT they own is transferred to the unNFT smart contract. Once the unNFT is listed, the user can unlist and then unwrap it, and take back the underlying NFT, at any time. Listing, unlisting, and escrow are handled directly by the unNFT smart contract. It is, however, no longer possible for the Minter to unwrap the unNFT once a sale agreement has been reached between buyer and seller.

**Unwrapping**

No one, not even the untrading.org platform and their employees, can unilaterally unwrap an unNFT.

![Figure 5: Multisig unwrapping](../.gitbook/assets/Multisig\_unwrapping.jpg)

The untrading.org platform or the new owner of unNFT can initiate an unwrapping request in certain circumstances. The original Minter and all previous owners would be adversely affected if the original NFT was unwrapped and released to the current unNFT owner. On iob.fi DAO voting, the Minter and all affected previous owners must approve the process within the sliding window (see description in the Specification section). Aye votes will instruct the third party to sign the vault and unwrap the original NFT.

Extreme FR percentage settings can result in the unNFT being rejected by the market if the Minter sets them too large or too small. This can make the particular unNFT unsellable in competitive markets. If this is the case, the current owner or untrading.org can propose to unwrap the unNFT. &#x20;

In the event an unwrapping resolution is passed, a multisignature-unwrapping signing process is triggered and will undergo inside the unNFT smart contract. For the unwrapping to be successful, 2 of 3 approval signatures will have to be made: one by the current holder of the unNFT and either one by the untrading.org platform or the third-party institutional custodian (see _Figure 5_). The underlying NFT will be released to the last unNFT holder who has co-signed the unwrapping agreement.

The unNFT smart contract multisig component is built in combination with Gnosis Safe smart contracts.

### <mark style="color:blue;">2.4</mark>        Burning <a href="#h.bio675l31tr" id="h.bio675l31tr"></a>

Burning refers to the action of redeeming unNFT for the underlying NFT tokens. Only if the unwrapping process was approved can the unNFT tokens be burnt. In order to do so, the burn function is called in the contract with the number of tokens to be burnt on the Ethereum chain. By doing so, the amount is deducted from the unNFT balance (on-chain) held by the last owner‚Äôs wallet.&#x20;

Additionally, the o-tokens associated with the unNFT will also be burnt on the blockchain.

## <mark style="color:red;">03</mark>        Specification <a href="#h.sdzwoztnri38" id="h.sdzwoztnri38"></a>

We are implementing our EIP-5173 extension using the ERC721 standard, with additional extensions proposed by EIP-2981 and EIP-4910 for on-chain royalty distribution.

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol";

/* *
@dev Interface for the Future Rewards Token Standard.

A standardized way to receive future rewards for non-fungible tokens (NFTs.)

*/ 
interface InFR is IERC165 {

    event FRClaimed(address indexed account, uint256 indexed amount);

    event FRDistributed(uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 indexed soldPrice, uint256 indexed allocatedFR);

    function list(uint256 tokenId, uint256 salePrice) external;

    function unlist(uint256 tokenId) external;

    function buy(uint256 tokenId) payable external;

    function releaseFR(address payable account) external;

    function retrieveFRInfo(uint256 tokenId) external returns(uint8, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, address[] memory);

    function retrieveAllottedFR(address account) external returns(uint256);

    function retrieveListInfo(uint256 tokenId) external returns(uint256, address, bool);

}

interface IERC165 { 
    /// @notice Query if a contract implements an interface 
    /// @param interfaceID The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165 
    /// @dev Interface identification is specified in ERC-165. This function 
    /// uses less than 30,000 gas. 
    /// @return true if the contract implements interfaceID and 
    /// interfaceID is not 0xffffffff, false otherwise 
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool); 
}
```

Each Token ID is updated. The data in the `FRInfo` struct is stored wholly in a single mapping. The struct is exposed in a public mapping with functions for accessing data. This is for client-side data fetching and verification.

```
struct FRInfo {
        uint8 numGenerations; //  Number of generations corresponding to that Token ID
        uint256 percentOfProfit; // Percent of profit allocated for FR, scaled by 1e18
        uint256 successiveRatio; // The common ratio of successive in the geometric sequence, used for distribution calculation
        uint256 lastSoldPrice; // Last sale price in ETH mantissa
        uint256 ownerAmount; // Amount of owners the Token ID has seen
        address[] addressesInFR; // The addresses currently in the FR cycle
}

struct ListInfo {
        uint256 salePrice; // ETH mantissa of the listed selling price
        address lister; // Owner/Lister of the Token
        bool isListed; // Boolean indicating whether the Token is listed or not
}
```

Additionally, there exists a `ListInfo` struct mapping with a corresponding function to retrieve its contents for each token ID.&#x20;

The amount of Ether allocated to a specific address using the `_allottedFR` mapping is constantly updated. The `_allottedFR` mapping is either public or has a function to fetch the FR payment allotted to a specific address.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.1</mark>        Percent Fixed Point <a href="#h.7xn6jwxzmyty" id="h.7xn6jwxzmyty"></a>

The `allocatedFR` is calculated using a percentage fixed point with a scaling factor of 1e18 (X/1e18) - such as "5e16" - for 5%. This is to maintain uniformity across the standard. The max and min values would be ‚Äì 1e18 - 1.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.2</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>       Default FR Info <a href="#h.p667888cftma" id="h.p667888cftma"></a>

A default `FRInfo` is stored in order to be backward compatible with ERC721 mint functions. It also has a function to update the `FRInfo`, assuming it has not been hard-coded.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**3.3**</mark>**       EIP-2535 Diamonds Upgradability and Modularity**

The codebase is broken up into facets with their respective facet storages using the Diamond storage pattern as defined in [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). The central diamond serves as the core contract and stores all of the contract data. This allows the entire contract‚Äôs functionality to be completely upgradable and modular. As the diamond contract has no functions but rather references a deployment of a facet. An access system is implemented which allows a designated address (or contract) to call the `diamondCut` function to modify the contract.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.4</mark>      o-tokends

Whenever a token is minted o-tokens will be distributed between the platform and the minter with `_distributeOTokens` internally. Balances and info for a given token ID can be retrieved with `retrieveORInfo` and `balanceOfOTokens`. OR rewards for a given address can be retrieved with `retrieveAllottedOR` and claimed with `releaseOR`. Additionally, `transferOTokens` can be used to transfer one‚Äôs o-tokens. Finally, whenever a profitable sale has been made `_distributeOR` is triggered.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.5</mark>       On-chain Licensing

Implementing a16z‚Äôs [CantBeEvil licensing](https://a16zcrypto.com/introducing-nft-licenses/) with a per-token ID modification allows each NFT minted on our contracts to have an immutable and on-chain license. Whenever each token is minted a license type is provided, which is then able to be retrieved at any time for that specific token ID with `getLicenseName` and `getLicenseURI`.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.</mark><mark style="color:blue;">**6**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;"></mark>       ERC721 Overrides <a href="#h.muwvdcauc8v2" id="h.muwvdcauc8v2"></a>

We override the ERC721 `_mint`, `_transfer`, and `_burn` functions. When overriding the `_mint`  function, a default FR model is established if the mint is to succeed when calling the ERC721 `_mint` function and not the nFR `_mint`  function. It is also to update the owner amount and directly add the recipient address to the FR cycle. When overriding the `_transfer` function, the smart contract will consider the NFT as sold for 0 ETH, and update state accordingly after a successful transfer. This is to prevent FR circumvention. Finally, when overriding the `_burn` function, the smart contract deletes the `FRInfo` corresponding to that Token ID after a successful burn.

Additionally, the ERC721 `_checkOnERC721Received` function is explicitly called after mints and transfers if the smart contract aims to have safe transfers and mints.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.7</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>       Safe Transfers <a href="#h.y5c8t8wqgv57" id="h.y5c8t8wqgv57"></a>

If the wallet/broker/auction application will accept safe transfers, then it  implements the ERC721 wallet interface.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.8</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>       Listing, Unlisting, and Buying <a href="#h.epik9qj3qr61" id="h.epik9qj3qr61"></a>

The `list`, `unlist`, and `buy` functions are implemented, and they provide the capability to sell a token.

```
function list(uint256 tokenId, uint256 salePrice) public virtual override {
   //...
}

function unlist(uint256 tokenId) public virtual override {
   //...
}

function buy(uint256 tokenId) public virtual override payable {
   //...
}
```

The `list` function accepts a `tokenId` and a `salePrice` and updates the corresponding `ListInfo` for that given `tokenId` after ensuring that the `msg.sender` is either approved or the owner of the token. The function signifies that the token is listed and at what price it is listed for.

The `unlist` function accepts a `tokenId` and it deletes the corresponding `ListInfo` after the owner verifications have been met.

The `buy` function accepts a `tokenId` and is payable. It verifies that the `msg.value` matches the token‚Äôs `salePrice` and that the token is listed, before proceeding and calling the FR `_transferFrom` function. This is to ensure the values are valid and will also allow for the necessary FR to be held in the contract.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.9</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>       Future Rewards  `_transferFrom`  Function

The FR `transferFrom` function is called. It ensures backward compatibility for secondary platforms that do not support our nFR standard.&#x20;

```
function _transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 soldPrice) internal virtual {
       //...
}
```

Based on the stored `lastSoldPrice`, the smart contract will determine whether the sale was profitable after calling the ERC721 transfer function and transferring the NFT. If it was not profitable, the smart contract updates the last sold price for the corresponding Token ID, increments the owner amount, shifts the generations, and transfers all of the `msg.value` to the `lister` depending on the implementation. Otherwise, if the transaction was profitable, the smart contract calls the `_distributeFR` function, then updates the `lastSoldPrice`, increments the owner amount, and finally shifts generations. The `_distributeFR` function returns the difference between the allocated FR that is to be distributed amongst the `_addressesInFR` and the `msg.value` to the `lister`.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.10</mark>        Distribution of NFT Royalties to Artists and Creators <a href="#h.94w0lmnqe8uq" id="h.94w0lmnqe8uq"></a>

#### **On-chain royalty distribution**

We agree that artists‚Äô royalties should be uniform and on-chain. We support both [EIP-4910](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/4910/commits/8fd87b4ec3dbfce40e38325f3b8a69f337368661\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1656705403383618\&usg=AOvVaw2ca3llLvMuPpYPISy11VNG) and [EIP-2981](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1656705403383967\&usg=AOvVaw1AyEhOtLAHi3Mwmw2vfgzw) proposals.

All platforms can support royalty rewards for the same NFT based on on-chain parameters and functions:

* No profit, no profit sharing, no cost;
* The question of "who owned it" is often crucial to the provenance and value of a collectible;
* The previous owner should be re-compensated for their ownership;
* And the buyer/owner incentive in FR eliminates any motive to circumvent the royalty payout schemes;

#### **Distribution of NFT Owners‚Äô Future Rewards (FRs)**

In addition to the on-chain Originator Rewards (OR, similar to royalty payments on other platforms) calculation and distribution, we calculate futures rewards for each owner generation defined in the calculating sliding window ( _n_ ). Everyone who falls within this sliding window receives a portion of the FRs from the subsequent n generations of future owners.

```
function _calculateFR(uint256 totalProfit, uint256 buyerReward, uint256 successiveRatio, uint256 ownerAmount, uint256 windowSize) pure internal virtual returns(uint256[] memory) {
    //...        
}
```

#### **Converting Rewards formula into Code**

As explained in Section 2.3 The un-token, all untrading.org fees are based on the realized profits from a sale of an unNFT.

![Reward formula](../.gitbook/assets/image4.png)

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
//...

/* Assumes usage of a Fixed Point Arithmetic library (prb-math) for both int256 and uint256, and OpenZeppelin Math utils for Math.min. */
function _calculateFR(uint256 P, uint256 r, uint256 g, uint256 m, uint256 w) pure internal virtual returns(uint256[] memory) {
        uint256 n = Math.min(m, w);
        uint256[] memory FR = new uint256[](n);

        for (uint256 i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            uint256 pi = 0;

            if (successiveRatio != 1e18) {
                int256 v1 = 1e18 - int256(g).powu(n);
                int256 v2 = int256(g).powu(i - 1);
                int256 v3 = int256(P).mul(int256(r));
                int256 v4 = v3.mul(1e18 - int256(g));
                pi = uint256(v4 * v2 / v1);
            } else {
                pi = P.mul(r).div(n);
            }

            FR[n - i] = pi;
        }

        return FR;
}
```

The complete code can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/unTrading/eip-5173-reference-implementation\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1656705403392982\&usg=AOvVaw0UCmdufk1V3aEUD3p\_BXwP).

In the example in _Figure 1_ in Section 2.2, detailed in _Table 2_ below, if an unNFT is sold for $50,000 worth of ETH and it resulted in a $10,000 profit for the seller, the seller shares a portion of their net profit with 10 previous holders of the token. Future Rewards will also be paid to the same seller as the value of the token increases from up to 10 subsequent owners.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Algorithm description table.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Table 2: Future Rewards (nFR) distribution example</em></p></figcaption></figure>

When an owner loses money during their holding period, they will not be obligated to share Future Rewards distributions, since there is no profit to share. However, he still receives a share of Future Rewards distributions from future generations of owners, if they are profitable.

![Figure 6: Future Rewards (nFR) distribution](../.gitbook/assets/nFR\_Distribution.jpeg)

_Figure 6_ illustrates an example of a five-generation Future Rewards Distribution program based on an owner's realized profit.

```
function _distributeFR(uint256 tokenId, uint256 soldPrice) internal virtual {
       //...

        emit FRDistributed(tokenId, soldPrice, allocatedFR);
}
```

The `_distributeFR` function is called in the FR `transferFrom` function if there is a profitable sale. The function calculates the difference between the current sale price and the `lastSoldPrice`, then it calls the `_calculateFR` function to receive the proper distribution of FR. Then it distributes the FR accordingly, making order adjustments as necessary. Then, the contract calculates the total amount of FR that was distributed (`allocatedFR`), in order to return the difference of the `soldPrice` and `allocatedFR` to the `lister`. Finally, it emits the `FRDistributed` event.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.11</mark>        Future Rewards Claiming <a href="#h.okyrx5dxooc3" id="h.okyrx5dxooc3"></a>

The future Rewards payments utilize a pull-payment model, similar to that demonstrated by OpenZeppelin with their PaymentSplitter contract. The event `FRClaimed` would be triggered after a successful claim has been made.

```
function releaseFR(address payable account) public virtual override {
        //...

### <mark style="color:blue;">3.12</mark>        Generation Shifting of Owner <a href="#h.egicuxvwhm1y" id="h.egicuxvwhm1y"></a>

The `_shiftGenerations` function is called regardless of whether the sale was profitable or not. As a result, it will be called in the `_transfer` ERC721 override function and the FR `transferFrom` function. The function removes the oldest account from the corresponding  `_addressesInFR` array. This calculation will take into account the current length of the array versus the total number of generations for a given token ID.

## <mark style="color:red;">04</mark>        Challenges <a href="#h.pz2qg6x3jpj5" id="h.pz2qg6x3jpj5"></a>

As a cryptocurrency payment facilitator, untrading.org faces the same security risks as other blockchain projects. As the untrading.org platform is built upon a mutually beneficial relationship between the chain of ownership, wash trading poses a challenge to the validity of the entire concept. The promise and advantages of the platform could be undermined if the fake ownership issue is not addressed and mitigated.

### <mark style="color:blue;">4.1</mark>        Payment Attacks <a href="#h.s0lg58qd2yq9" id="h.s0lg58qd2yq9"></a>

As this EIP introduces royalty and realized profit rewards collection, distribution, and payouts to the ERC721 standard, the attack vectors increase. As discussed in EIP-4910 and other mitigations to phishing attacks by Andreas Freund, we recommend reentrancy protection for all payment functions to reduce the most significant attack vectors for payments and payouts.

### <mark style="color:blue;">4.2</mark>        Royalty Circumventing <a href="#h.h53k0k6nm2lb" id="h.h53k0k6nm2lb"></a>

Many methods are being used to avoid paying royalties to creators under the current ERC721 standard. Through an under-the-table transaction, the new buyer's cost basis will be reduced to zero, increasing their FR liability to the full selling price. Everyone, either the buyer or seller, would pay a portion of the previous owner's net realized profits ( P x r ). Acting in their own interests, the buyer rejects any loyalty circumventing or false price reporting proposal from the seller.

### <mark style="color:blue;">4.3</mark>        FR Hoarding through Wash Sales <a href="#h.ikri8ptl69nn" id="h.ikri8ptl69nn"></a>

Quantexa blog \[3] and BeInCrypto \[4] articles have reported widespread wash trading on all unregulated cryptocurrency trading platforms and NFT marketplaces. The use of wash trading by dishonest actors can lead to an unfair advantage, as well as inflated prices and money laundering. When a single entity becomes multiple generations of owners to accumulate more rewards in the future, the validity of the system is undermined.

#### **Wash trading by users**

Using a different wallet address, an attacker can "sell" the NFT to themselves at a loss. It is possible to repeat this process n times in order to maximize their share of the subsequent FR distributions (see _Figure 7_). A wallet ranking score can partially alleviate this problem. It is evident that a brand new wallet is a red flag, and the marketplace may withhold FR distribution from it if it has a short transaction history (i.e. fewer than a certain number of transactions).

We do not want a large portion of future rewards to go to a small number of wash traders. Making such practices less profitable is one way to discourage wash trading and award hoarding. It can be partially mitigated, for example, by implementing a wallet-score and holding a period-based incentive system. The rewards for both parties are reduced if a new wallet is used or if a holding period is less than a certain period.

**Long/Cyclical FR-Entitled Owner Generations**

In most cases, malicious actors will create excessively long or cyclical Future Rewards Owner Generations that will result in applications that attempt to distribute FR or shift generations running out of gas and not functioning. Therefore, clients are responsible for verifying that the contract with which they interact has an appropriate number of generations, so that looping over will not deplete the gas.

**User reputation**

This platform will use both on-chain and market intelligence tools in order to establish the reputation of sellers and buyers.

A portion of the rewards for wallets with low reputation scores will be held in an escrow wallet for a specified period of time. Any potential fraudulent activity can be reported by anyone. Users who have successfully investigated, reported, and validated a fraudulent transaction will receive a share of the withheld reward amount.

If no contests are successfully upheld, the amounts withheld in the escrow wallets will be released to the originally designated recipients.

**IOB token staking**

A certain amount of IOB tokens must be staked by both sellers and buyers in order to participate in the iob.fi DAO voting for specific proposals related to transactions, as well as for underlying NFT unwrapping and changes to the platform rules and policies.

Wash trades will result in the confiscation and redistribution of fraudsters' staked IOB tokens, among other punishments.

#### **Wash trading by the marketplace operator**

However, the biggest offender appears to be the marketplace, which engages heavily in wash trading, or simply does not care about it, according to Decrypt \[5]. The authors have personally experienced this phenomenon. A senior executive of a top-5 cryptocurrency exchange boasted during a mid-night drinking session in 2018, that they had "brushed" (wash-traded) certain newly listed tokens, which they called "market-making." \[6]

It is common for these companies to engage in wash trading independently or collude with certain users, and royalties and FR payments are reimbursed under the table. Moreover, we pledge to uphold the no-fraud policy and will implement robust tools to prevent self-trading, which will facilitate users' ability to observe our business practices in a transparent manner. With untrading.org, customers will be able to access on-chain transaction monitoring services, including Chainalysis Reactor and Nansen, for free.

## <mark style="color:red;">05</mark>        Summary <a href="#h.10bykgn0hh1c" id="h.10bykgn0hh1c"></a>

At untrading.org, we aim to create a virtuous economic environment for the financial sector, removing conflicts of interest between exchanges and their users and ending zero-sum trading.

The untrading.org platform enables users to participate in a gift economy based on EIP-5173 published in June 2022 by iob.fi DAO. Although it is not a charity or philanthropic endeavor, it helps all of its users - the creators, buyers, and sellers - as well as the organization's stakeholders build greater wealth through each other's success. There is no longer a zero-sum game when it comes to trading.

### <mark style="color:blue;">5.1</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>       Getting Compensated to Participate in Price Discovery <a href="#h.rqo4d8vvcwy9" id="h.rqo4d8vvcwy9"></a>

#### **Buyer and seller both earn more**

The framework offered by untrading.org, in addition to being desired by customers, is also justified by its existence since the value of a collectible is often determined by its provenance and history as well as the owner's ownership history. It is often the history of ownership that determines the price of a physical collectible, so its history of ownership is of paramount importance.

Therefore, we should retroactively compensate all parties for their contributions to the early stages of price discovery, including their community status, reputation, and early contributions.

In every stage of the token's ownership history, untrading.org builds a profit-sharing structure that all market participants can take advantage of.

#### **Minter can be anyone**

Be the first to establish the price discovery process for a potential valuable item, or to upgrade a blue-chip NFT you already own, by minting it to receive a perpetual on-chain royalty payments, plus the enhanced Future Rewards by defining the terms of such reward rules.

### <mark style="color:blue;">5.2</mark>       On-chain Royalty & FR Payments <a href="#h.jnuu1wou4dfg" id="h.jnuu1wou4dfg"></a>

The Future Rewards framework is based on smart contract rules on-chain, not relying on off-chain rules that may or may not be implemented by various marketplaces;

### <mark style="color:blue;">5.3</mark>        New Trading Platform Model <a href="#h.tujj5q3ywqn" id="h.tujj5q3ywqn"></a>

For untrading.org to be successful, several key technical and operational components must be integrated:

* Implementation of EIP-5173, EIP-2981, and some aspects of EIP-4910 for accurate and reliable on-chain royalty distribution and FRs;
* Developing the escrow smart contract for fair, safe, on-chain, and verifiable trading;
* Secure smart contracts and multisig wallets for on-chain payments that are safe and fast;
* A mechanism for detecting wash trades and a voting system for policing and updating the rules on the iob.fi DAO. &#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">5.4</mark>        A New Era <a href="#h.bb1agjf40cyb" id="h.bb1agjf40cyb"></a>

Since the new technology building blocks are ready, it is finally possible to do this with the non-fungible token standard and several extensions, including our EIP-5173.&#x20;

As a next-generation exchange, untrading.org builds on a gift economic model where members pay it forward to end centuries of zero-sum trading.&#x20;

When all market participants adopt this platform, it has the potential to reach far beyond the art world, with the market being worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

### <mark style="color:blue;">5.5</mark>        Community Powered & Powering the Community <a href="#h.bb1agjf40cyb" id="h.bb1agjf40cyb"></a>

We believe that crypto success to date has been built on the community generating value, yet when we trade we rely on archaic models of a zero-sum game, where one person's gain in a transaction is another's loss.&#x20;

We build and protect value through community, so why not share value through it?&#x20;

It is common for people to lose interest in a community when they sell a token.

However, even if a token is sold through the EIP-5173 framework, you continue to contribute to the asset's growth and community.&#x20;

Through EIP-5173, the community is strengthened, its history is maintained, and a sense of purpose is generated.
