# üîç How to Use untrading.org Testnet

untrading is a revolutionary platform that allows you to invest in cryptocurrencies with enhanced profitability, transparency and ownership history. By using the innovative Decentralized Strategy As A Platform (dSaaP) created by ERC-5173, you can participate in the future value increase of your tokens even after you sell them. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the testnet version of untrading to get familiar with its features and functionalities.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need the following:

* A web browser that supports Web3, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Brave.
* A MetaMask wallet extension installed on your browser and connected to the Ethereum testnet (Sepolia and Goerli), as well as the Polygon testnet (Mumbai).
* Some test ETH and test MATIC in your MetaMask wallet.&#x20;
* A basic understanding of cryptocurrency trading concepts, such as tokens, swaps, and wrapping.

### Step 1: Acquire Test Tokens

To use untrading, you will need some test tokens that represent different cryptocurrencies. You can swap your test ETH for test WBTC, test WETH, test USDT, and test USDC on the [https://testnet.untrading.org/](https://testnet.untrading.org/) testnet.

* You can get test ETH for free from a faucet (we recommend a Sepolia faucet): [https://goerlifaucet.com/](https://goerlifaucet.com/), [https://sepoliafaucet.com/](https://sepoliafaucet.com/), and [https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia).
* Some test MATIC from [https://mumbaifaucet.com/](https://mumbaifaucet.com/).
* Go to the [https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos](https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos) testnet and click on the Test Tokens button.
* Select the blockchain from the drop-down menu.
* Select the desired output token from the drop-down menus.
* Follow the instructions on the screen for WBTC, WETH, USDC or USDT.
* Click on "Swap" and confirm the transaction on MetaMask.
* Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.&#x20;
* Repeat the process for other tokens you want to acquire.

### Step 2: Buy unBTC and unETH Offerings

Once you have some test USDC and USDT tokens, you can buy unBTC and unETH on [https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos](https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos).&#x20;

* To buy an existing offering, go to [https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos](https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos) and click on the ‚ÄúMarkets" tab.&#x20;
* Browse the available offerings and find one that matches your preferences.
* Click on the ‚ÄúBuy - Limit" button and enter the amount of tokens you want to buy.
* Click on ‚ÄúBuy - Limit"Ôºåapprove amount of payment tokens then confirm the transaction on MetaMask.
* Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. You can check the status on Etherscan.

You will receive the tokens you bought and the seller will receive the tokens you paid.&#x20;

### Step 3: Wrap unBTC and unETH

untrading uses its own tokens, called unBTC and unETH, to enable the dSaaP features. These tokens are wrapped versions of WBTC and WETH, which are ERC-20 tokens that represent Bitcoin and Ether on the Ethereum network. To wrap your WBTC and WETH into unBTC/USDT and unETH/USDC, follow these steps:

* In the upper-right corner of [https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos](https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos), click the "Wrap Crypto" menu under your Avatar.
* Select WBTC as the Original token and  USDT as the Payment token from the drop-down menus.
* Enter the amount of WBTC you want to wrap or click on "Max" to wrap all your WBTC.
* Enter the Total Reward Ratio, Originator Reward Ratio (OR) and Number of Generations you are specifying for this unique unToken.&#x20;
* Click on "Wrap" and confirm the transaction on MetaMask.
* Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. You can check the status on Etherscan.
* Repeat the process for WETH .

### Step 4: List, Sell and Make Changes to unBTC and unETH Offerings

**Turn your test unBTC/unETH into rewards! Sell them on the marketplace and unlock your Testnet earnings.**

To sell an existing offering, go to [https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos](https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos) and click on the Avatar.

* Click the "Profile" menu and find the offering you want to sell and click on the ‚ÄúSell‚Äù button.
* Enter the amount of tokens you want to sell and the price per token you want to receive.
* Click on the "List for sale" button and confirm the transaction on MetaMask.
* Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. You can check the status on Etherscan.

To change an existing offering price, go to [https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos](https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos) and click on the Avatar.

* Click the "Profile" menu and find the offering you want to change and click into detail page.
* Open the "..." menu under the price and click "Change price".
* Modify the amount of token you want to sell and the price per token you want to receive.
* Click on the "Change price" button and confirm the transaction on MetaMask.
* Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. You can check the status on Etherscan.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to use the testnet version of untrading, a commission-free crypto investment protocol that enables token owners to benefit from future price increases even after selling their tokens. Once you‚Äôve bought your unBTC and unETH, please immediately list them for sale so other users can buy your tokens. The real magic happens after you have sold them as you can now watch your Future Rewards grow. This is the fundamental difference between untrading and any other platforms.

You can now explore the platform and experiment with different trading strategies. Remember, this is a testnet version, so the tokens you use have no real value and the platform may not be fully functional or stable.&#x20;
