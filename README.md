iob.fi DAO is a DAO-governed, non-custodial, and on-chain DeFi **hedged pool manager**. iob.fi enables both **retail investors** and **institutional traders** the opportunity to invest in _all asset classes_ including cryptos, stocks, commodities, and indices in one place with just a **Web3 wallet** _without border or fiat currency restriction_.&#x20;

The project was launched as iob.vc in July 2017 and was rebranded as iob.fi DAO in October 2020. iob.fi DAO's Web3 layer enables institutional trading systems to connect to DeFi platforms through smart-contract-native interactions, solving some of the incompatibility issues between high-frequency trading (HFT) and cryptocurrency on-chain trading.

## Why this is a big deal:

iob.fi DAO is committed to making sure that our traders in the future will have **no longer need to** set up trading accounts all over the world (as we have been doing until now): New York, Chicago, Shanghai, London, Frankfurt, Sydney... nor is there a need to make foreign currency exchanges to fund those accounts.&#x20;
