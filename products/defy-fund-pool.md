# Defy Hedged Pool

iob Defy Hedged Pool is one of the first tokenized, actively managed DeFi hedged pools in the world. Defy will invest in derivatives of non-correlated asset classes including cryptocurrencies, commodities, and stock futures. The objective of the Defy Hedged Pool is low-risk, stable growth with a targeted annual return in the low double digits.

Based on an Aragon DAO, Defy Hedged Pool is a professionally-managed hedged pool that operates entirely on the blockchain. Besides enabling accounting, auditing, and account management on-chain, Defy is powered by a smart-contract-native trading system that directly interacts with Uniswap, Synthetix and Balancer. The poolâ€™s assets are safely kept in its own smart contracts and in some cases, trades are executed with 0 slippage.
