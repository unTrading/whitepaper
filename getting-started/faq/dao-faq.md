# DAOs

### What is the iob.fi DAO management team?

There is no central leadership, decisions are made in a bottom-up way. It has its own rules, such as how to manage funds that belong to iob.fi. The organization is running under a global network of contributors. The core contributors can be reached [here](https://discord.gg/nszVFC).&#x20;

### Where is iob.fi DAO registered?

The DAO structure gives internet communities unprecedented power to organize around shared values and resources. There is no centralized registration or any national borders.

### How is iob.fi DAO organized by its contributing members?

Decentralized organizations can solve some of the traditional companies' worst problems. All of us are not constrained by geography. Members work remotely by a shared vision.

### If the core members control all the important mattes and even act as a 'central bank,' how decentralized is iob.fi DAO?

We intend to give all the control to the community. However, we can only do it in a gradual, guided, and controlled way towards the state of total democracy.&#x20;

During Phase 1 of the DAO deployment, only some of the core members are designated to make policy proposals. The entire community of FI and IOB holders is still entitled to vote for each proposal. A proposal is enacted only after it receives the required vote counts. Phase 2 will give any token holder the right to make proposals on most business policies for the community to vote. In Phase 3, the community is given the total control of iob.fi DAO and anyone can make a proposal on any policy matters.&#x20;

### What is the voting-power difference between IOB and FI?&#x20;

IOB holders can vote on ALL matters on iob.fi DAO through wIOB while FI holders can vote on most, but not all policies. For instance, FI cannot vote on IOB to FI conversion proposals. However, most FI holders are at the same time IOB holders during the first two phases of DAO's deployment, we do not see a drastic conflict between the two camps.
