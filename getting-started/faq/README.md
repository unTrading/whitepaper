## General Questions

### What is iob.fi DAO?

iob.fi is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) hedged pool manager and a DeFi technology developer.

### What does iob.fi DAO do?

iob.fi manages multi-asset-class hedged pools aiming to achieve superior returns with controlled max drawdowns.

Unable to find a Web3 solution in order to interact with the various DeFi platforms by our "black box" trading system, we have decided to develop one, the Prodefy platform, for our quantitative trading platform. Other institutional traders can use it too as we are developing Prodefy as an open-source project in partnership with several Wall Street veterans.&#x20;

### Why iob.fi DAO?

iob.fi seeks consistent capital appreciation. With over 20 years in managing various types of funds totaling billions of dollars, iob.fi founding members have developed a cryptocurrency trading system called ioBots. ioBots is a set of rule-based algorithmic trading strategies, order, risk, and asset management tools.

In the past 12 months, ioBots has demonstrated above-average returns in real-time, real-money trading while being constantly developed. Changes were made daily sometimes. The ioBots-generated trading signals have been tracked in real-time on [iobots.pro](https://iobots.pro). If the signals automatically invested with $10,000 each time, the model portfolio would have made over 150% in the first 12-month period. ioBots has added new markets continuously and gradually. The original 6 starting markets (crypto pairs) have demonstrated gains ranging from 183.9% to 597.35% for the first 12 months.

### **Who is behind iob.fi DAO?**

A team of financial and blockchain veterans has been working over four years to build iob.fi since early 2016. As the nascent DeFi technology evolves, we will never stop innovating together with other industry-leading projects such as Uniswap, TokenSets, Balancer, and the others to help bring decentralized finance to go mainstream.

**Yale ReiSoleil**&#x20;

Having started his financial career in 1996, Yale worked in mutual funds, venture capital, private equity, and hedge funds with high-frequency trading (HFT) partners. With his diverse experience in several financial sectors managing over $3 billion funds, Yale has been a pioneer in utilizing and advancing emerging financial technologies. Yale and Dr. D were trailblazers in HFT in China. In 2013, they partnered with China Telecom to build the first dedicated trans-Pacific fiber-optic line linking the New York main financial data hub to their Shanghai-based commodities hedge fund.&#x20;

An unexpected event in 2015 propelled Yale to look into the fledgling decentralized currencies called Bitcoin and Ether. Having spent millions building a proprietary ‘black box’ algorithmic trading hardware and software system co-located in Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) datacenter, the firm’s good time in being one of the biggest stock index futures HFT traders in China came to an abrupt halt when the local government banned HFT index futures trading and limited all order size to 1 contract. Being aware of the danger posed by any centralized authorities led him to make his first purchases of BTC at $430 and ETH at $8.&#x20;

Yale is the fund manager of [Quasar Fund](https://iobots.pro), chief architect of ioBots trading algorithms, and a firm believer in decentralized finance (DeFi).&#x20;
